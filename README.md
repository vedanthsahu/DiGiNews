# DigiNews

DigiNews is a dynamic website designed to provide users with an enhanced news browsing experience. Unlike many traditional news websites, DigiNews allows users to search for word meanings directly within the site itself, eliminating the need for dependence on any third-party platforms. Additionally, DigiNews offers a personalized news feed based on user interests through the implementation of a like button feature.

## Key Features

- Sections of news, including technology, business, and sports, to enable easy navigation and focused reading.
- Top news and breaking news sections to keep users informed with the latest updates.
- Search bar to conveniently look up the meanings of words within the site.
- Responsive design for seamless accessibility on both mobile and desktop devices.
- Regular updates of news content to ensure users have access to current and relevant information.

## Technologies Used

- APIs: News API, Dictionary API, providing up-to-date news articles and word meanings.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating an interactive and user-friendly website.
- JSON for data exchange between the server and the website.

## Usage

DigiNews aims to simplify the news browsing process for users, providing organized sections for various topics, top news, and breaking news. Users can explore articles accompanied by images and brief introductions, and by clicking on a news piece, they can access the full content. The like button allows users to personalize their news feed based on their preferences. Additionally, users can search for the meanings of unfamiliar words directly within the site using the search prompt.

Please note that access to DigiNews is currently restricted during its development phase. Once deployed, users can access the website just like any other regular site through their web browsers.

## Contributions

Developers are welcome to contribute to DigiNews by identifying and fixing any bugs, as well as suggesting new ideas to further enhance the website's functionality and user experience.

Users can actively engage with the website by browsing news articles and utilizing the like feature to receive a personalized news feed.
